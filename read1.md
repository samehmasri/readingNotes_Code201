# Structure
* web pages act like an electronic version of documents.
* Documents of all kind, structure's is an important to make it easier 
for the readers to understand what they are reading.
*  HTML helps us to write the stucture of the document in all of his type 
which gives the ability to implement the headings,sub-headings and 
all the necessary features of the documents.
* HTML headings and sub-heading high-lights the most important information,
usually the first heading contain the name of the important info. and the 
followed by the important information. and it also used to separate and categorize the info.
## HTML definition
> The HTML code is made up of characters that live inside angled
brackets — these are called HTML elements. Elements are usually
made up of two tags: an opening tag and a closing tag. (The closing tag
has an extra forward slash in it.) Each HTML element tells the browser
something about the information that sits between its opening and
closing tags.
> Tags act like containers. They tell you
something about the information that lies
between their opening and closing tags.
* html tags are written like: left-angle bracket,a chracter, right-angle bracket **<some-charcter>**, and this type is called an opening tag, close tag are written the same way but u add a slash-back like this: **</some-charcter>**
### Attributes 
> Attributes provide additional information
about the contents of an element. They appear
on the opening tag of the element and are
made up of two parts: a name and a value,
separated by an equals sign. And written in this way **<some-charcter attribute-name = "attribute value >"**
* The attribute name indicates what kind of extra information i want to add. 
* The value is setting for the attribute.


# EXtra Markup
* DOCTYPES tell browsers which version of HTML you
are using.
* You can add comments to your code between the
<!-- and --> markers.
* The id and class attributes allow you to identify
particular elements.
* The <div> and <span> elements allow you to group
block-level and inline elements together.
* <iframes> cut windows into your web pages through
which other pages can be displayed.
* The <meta> tag allows you to supply all kinds of
information about your web page.
* Escape characters are used to include special
characters in your pages such as <, >, and ©.


# HTML layout

* The new HTML5 elements indicate the purpose of
different parts of a web page and help to describe
its structure.

* The new elements provide clearer code (compared
with using multiple <div> elements).

* Older browsers that do not understand HTML5
elements need to be told which elements are
block-level elements.

* To make HTML5 elements work in Internet Explorer 8
(and older versions of IE), extra JavaScript is needed,
which is available free from Google.

# Process and design 
* It's important to understand  who your target audience
is, why they would come to your site, what information
they want to find and when they are likely to return.

* Site maps allow you to plan the structure of a site.

* Wireframes allow you to organize the information that
will need to go on each page.

* Design is about communication. Visual hierarchy helps
visitors understand what you are trying to tell them.

* You can differentiate between pieces of information
using size, color, and style.

* You can use grouping and similarity to help simplify
the information you present.
