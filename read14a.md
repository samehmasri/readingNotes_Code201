# CSS Transforms, Transitions

> Transitions are the grease in the wheel of CSS transforms. Without a transition, an element being transformed would change abruptly from one state to another. By applying a transition you can control the change, making it smooth and gradual.


## CSS Animations

> CSS animations make it possible to animate transitions from one CSS style configuration to another. Animations consist of two components, a style describing the CSS animation and a set of keyframes that indicate the start and end states of the animation's style, as well as possible intermediate waypoints
