# What Google Learned About Teams
*  > In a time of global commerce, teamwork is more important than ever before. In the last two decades, teamwork in businesses has increased by 50% or more, and interpersonal communication accounts for 75% of an employee’s day. Businesses can’t afford to underestimate the power of strong teams.
Google’s “Project Artistotle” investigates why some teams work better than others. Its analysis shows that the combination of individuals making up the group is unimportant. Instead, a team’s “group norms” – its “traditions, behavioral standards and unwritten rules” – are essential to how well the group performs. Teams are successful if their group norms lead to equal speaking time for all individuals within the group and an awareness of others’ emotional states. These factors produce a situation in which members of the group feel comfortable, or “safe,” and therefore more willing to contribute. Google’s data show that what Harvard business professor Amy Edmondson called “psychological safety” within the group leads to an increase in the group’s collective IQ and therefore its effectiveness and productivity.
