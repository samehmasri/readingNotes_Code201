# HTML TEXT

* HTML elements are used to describe the structure of
the page (e.g. headings, subheadings, paragraphs).

* They also provide semantic information (e.g. where
emphasis should be placed, the definition of any
acronyms used, when given text is a quotation).

# CSS

* CSS treats each HTML element as if it appears inside
its own box and uses rules to indicate how that
element should look.

* Rules are made up of selectors (that specify the
elements the rule applies to) and declarations (that
indicate what these elements should look like).

* Different types of selectors allow you to target your
rules at different elements.

* Declarations are made up of two parts: the properties
of the element that you want to change, and the values
of those properties. For example, the font-family
property sets the choice of font, and the value arial
specifies Arial as the preferred typeface.

* CSS rules usually appear in a separate document,
although they may appear within an HTML page.

# javascript
# soruce

* If you view the source code of the page in the browser,
the JavaScript will not have changed the HTML,
because the script works with the model of the web
page that the browser has created.
# functions 
* Functions allow you to group a set of related
statements together that represent a single task.
* Functions can take parameters (informatiorJ required
to do their job) and may return a value.
*An object is a series of variables and functions that
represent something from the world around you.
* In an object, variables are known as properties of the
object; functions are known as methods of the object.
