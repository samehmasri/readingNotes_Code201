# **lists**
## There are three types of HTML lists: ordered,unordered, and definition.
**Ordered lists use numbers.**<ol><li></li></ol>  

**Unordered lists use bullets.**<ul><li></li></ol>

**Definition lists are used to define terminology.**

> **dL** The definition list is created with the **dl** element and usually consists of a series of terms and their definitions.

> **dt** This is used to contain the term being defined (the definition term).

> **dd** This is used to contain the definition.

**The form of definition list as following**

> **dl**

>**dt** here you can put the name of a thing you want to define </dt>

>**dd** the definition of the thing</dd> 


   </dl>

**Lists can be nested inside one another**

# **Boxes**

* CSS treats each HTML element as if it has its own box.
 
* You can use CSS to control the dimensions of a box.

* You can also control the borders, margin and padding
for each box with CSS.

* It is possible to hide elements using the display and
visibility properties.

* Block-level boxes can be made into inline boxes, and
inline boxes made into block-level boxes.

* Legibility can be improved by controlling the width of
boxes containing text and the leading.

* CSS3 has introduced the ability to create image
borders and rounded borders.

# **javascripts** 

* using quotes inside a string
single quotes, double quotes, or escaping using backslash

* using a variable to store boolean as following
var name = true/false 
> booleans make your code do certain codes depending on your value of the boolean

# **variables shorthand**

* variables can be declared as following:
var price, name, etc...

# **changing variable name**
after you declare a variable and you want to change the value of it
you only need to recall the var and use an = use whatever value YOU want

# **loops**
* Conditional statements allow your code to make
decisions about what to do next.

* Comparison operators (===, ! ==, ==, ! =, <, >, <=, =>)
are used to compare two operands.

* Logical operators allow you to combine more than one
set of comparison operators.

* if ... else statements allow you to run one set of code

* if a condition is true, and another if it is false.

* switch statements allow you to compare a value
against possible outcomes (and also provides a default
option if none match).

* All values evaluate to either true or false.

* There are three types of loop: for, while, and
do ... while. Each repeats a set of statements.
