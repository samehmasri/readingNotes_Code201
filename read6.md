# Object Literals
* The Document Object Model (DOM) specifies
how browsers should create a model of an HTML
page and how JavaScript can access and update the
contents of a web page while it is in the browser window.

* THE DOM TREE IS A MODEL OF A WEB PAGE

* Each node is an object with methods and properties.
Scripts access and update this DOM tree (not the source HTML file).
Any changes made to the DOM tree are reflected in the browser.

# WORKING WITH THE DOM TREE
1. ACCESS THE ELEMENTS
2. WORK WITH THOSE ELEMENTS
