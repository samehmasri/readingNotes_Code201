# lists & tables

* In addition to the CSS p XX roperties covered in other
chapters which work with the contents of all elements,
there are several others that are specifically used to
control the appearance of lists, tables, and forms.

*List markers can be given different appearances
using the list-style-type and list-style image
properties.

* Table cells can have different borders and spacing in
different browsers, but there are properties you can
use to control them and make them more consistent.
* Forms are easier to use if the form controls are
vertically aligned using CSS.

* Forms benefit from styles that make them feel more
interactive.
